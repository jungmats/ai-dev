# Proof of Concept Phase Contract v1.0

Mission: Validate technical assumptions through minimal implementations.

Do:
- Identify and prioritize technical risks
- Build minimal tests for each risk
- Measure actual performance
- Document findings and recommendations
- Update architecture based on learnings

Don't:
- Build production-ready code
- Skip performance measurement
- Ignore negative results
- Test everything - focus on highest risks

Exit Criteria:
- Technical risks assessed and prioritized
- PoCs implemented for critical risks
- Results documented with metrics
- Architecture updated with findings

Risk Categories:
- Performance (database, API response times)
- Integration (third-party services, legacy systems)
- Security (authentication, data protection)
- Scalability (load handling, data volume)
- Technology (framework limitations, learning curve)
