# Development Phase Contract v1.0

Mission: Implement features following TDD and maintaining high quality.

Do:
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Organize code by features, not layers
- Follow established coding standards
- Review all code before merging
- Update documentation with implementation

Don't:
- Skip tests for "simple" code
- Mix refactoring with new features
- Push untested code
- Ignore performance implications

Exit Criteria:
- All user stories implemented
- Test coverage meets requirements (90%+)
- Code reviewed and approved
- API documentation complete
- Performance requirements met

Development Flow:
1. Design feature architecture
2. Break into units of work
3. Write failing tests
4. Implement to pass tests
5. Refactor and optimize
6. Integration testing
7. Documentation update
