- Skip competitive analysis
- Make final decisions without evidence

Exit Criteria:
- Three research tracks completed
- Technology stack recommended with rationale
- Architecture patterns identified
- Risk mitigation strategies defined

Required Research Tracks:
1. Technology Analysis (frameworks, databases, hosting)
2. Best Practices (security, testing, deployment)
3. Competitive Analysis (features, tech stacks, gaps)
