# Core Development Contract

## Mission:
Establish universal standards and quality requirements for AI-driven development to ensure consistent, high-quality deliverables across all project phases while maintaining security, performance, and maintainability excellence.

## Universal Standards for AI-Driven Development

### Code Quality Standards

#### Clean Code Principles
- **Readability First**: Code should be self-documenting with clear variable and function names
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function and class should have one clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Don't repeat yourself - extract common functionality
- **YAGNI Principle**: You aren't gonna need it - avoid over-engineering
- **Consistent Style**: Follow established language conventions and project style guides

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Function Documentation**: All public functions must include purpose, parameters, return values, and examples
- **API Documentation**: All endpoints must be documented with request/response examples
- **README Files**: Clear setup, usage, and contribution instructions
- **Architectural Documentation**: High-level system design and decision rationale
- **Change Documentation**: All significant changes logged in CHANGELOG.md

### Testing Standards

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum 90% Code Coverage**: All new code must maintain this threshold
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Validate response times and resource usage

#### Test Quality Standards
- **Comprehensive Test Cases**: Include happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
- **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on order of execution
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should run quickly (< 1 second each)
- **Reliable Tests**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky

### Security Standards

#### Security by Design
- **Authentication Required**: All non-public endpoints must require authentication
- **Authorization Checks**: Verify user permissions for all operations
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode all outputs to prevent XSS
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries only

#### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Never log or expose passwords, tokens, or PII
- **Encryption Standards**: Use industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with proper timeouts
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication must use HTTPS in production
- **Security Headers**: Implement proper security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Performance Standards

#### Response Time Requirements
- **API Endpoints**: < 200ms for simple queries, < 2s for complex operations
- **Database Queries**: Optimize for minimal execution time and resource usage
- **Frontend Loading**: Initial page load < 3s, subsequent navigation < 1s
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management with proper cleanup
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from day one

#### Monitoring Requirements
- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, feature usage, conversion rates
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for performance degradation or errors
- **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate detail levels

### Architecture Standards

#### Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different system layers
- **Loose Coupling**: Components should be independent and replaceable
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together
- **Interface-Based Design**: Program to interfaces, not implementations
- **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration from code

#### Technology Standards
- **Version Control**: Git with meaningful commit messages and atomic commits
- **Dependency Management**: Lock file usage and regular security updates
- **Build Systems**: Reproducible builds with clear dependency chains
- **Environment Parity**: Development, staging, and production environment consistency
- **Backup Strategies**: Regular automated backups with tested restore procedures

### Development Process

#### Code Review Requirements
- **Peer Review**: All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
- **Review Checklist**: Use standardized checklist covering functionality, performance, security
- **Review Timeliness**: Reviews completed within 24 hours of submission
- **Review Quality**: Constructive feedback focused on improvement
- **Approval Gates**: No code merged without explicit approval

#### Quality Gates
- **Automated Testing**: All tests must pass before code integration
- **Static Analysis**: Code must pass linting and static analysis tools
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Testing**: Performance regression testing for critical paths
- **Documentation Updates**: Documentation must be updated with code changes

### Error Handling

#### Exception Management
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when non-critical components fail
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging with context and stack traces
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for end users
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented procedures for common error scenarios
- **Monitoring Integration**: Errors automatically trigger appropriate alerts

#### Debugging Support
- **Debug Information**: Sufficient logging for troubleshooting without sensitive data
- **Environment Identification**: Clear identification of environment in logs and errors
- **Correlation IDs**: Request tracking across system boundaries
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system health monitoring endpoints
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Built-in tools for system diagnosis and troubleshooting

### Compliance Requirements

#### Code Standards Compliance
- **Language Standards**: Follow official language style guides and best practices
- **Framework Compliance**: Adhere to chosen framework conventions and patterns
- **Industry Standards**: Follow relevant industry standards (REST, OpenAPI, etc.)
- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages and locales where applicable

#### Process Compliance
- **Change Management**: All changes tracked and approved through defined process
- **Release Management**: Structured release process with rollback capabilities
- **Documentation Currency**: All documentation kept current with system changes
- **Training Requirements**: Team members trained on standards and processes
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic compliance audits and improvement planning
