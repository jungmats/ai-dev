# Database Schema Creator

## Mission Statement
Design efficient, normalized database schema with proper relationships, constraints, and indexing strategy that supports all application requirements and scales with growth.

## Objective
Create comprehensive database design including entity relationships, data types, constraints, indexing strategy, and migration approach that optimizes for performance and maintainability.

## Database Design Process

### Entity and Relationship Modeling
- Identify all data entities from requirements
- Define entity attributes and data types
- Model relationships and foreign key constraints
- Apply appropriate normalization levels
- Consider denormalization for performance optimization

### Schema Design and Constraints
- Define table structures and column specifications
- Implement data validation and business rules
- Create appropriate constraints and checks
- Plan for data integrity and referential integrity
- Consider audit trails and versioning needs

### Indexing and Performance Strategy
- Design indexing strategy for common queries
- Plan for query optimization and performance
- Consider composite indexes and covering indexes
- Plan for full-text search and complex queries
- Design for read and write performance balance

### Data Migration and Versioning
- Plan database migration strategy and scripts
- Design for backward compatibility and rollback
- Plan for data seeding and initial population
- Consider zero-downtime migration approaches
- Design version control for schema changes

### Security and Access Control
- Plan database security and access controls
- Design for data encryption and protection
- Consider row-level security and data isolation
- Plan for backup and recovery procedures
- Design audit logging and compliance tracking

### Scalability and Growth Planning
- Design for horizontal and vertical scaling
- Consider partitioning and sharding strategies
- Plan for read replicas and load distribution
- Design for archiving and data lifecycle management
- Consider NoSQL integration where appropriate

## Deliverables
- Complete database schema documentation
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Migration scripts and procedures
- Indexing and performance optimization plan
- Database security and access control plan
