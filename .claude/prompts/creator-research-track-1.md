# Research Track 1: Framework & Technology Analysis

## Mission Statement
Conduct systematic analysis of frontend frameworks, backend technologies, database solutions, and infrastructure options to provide evidence-based technology recommendations for the project.

## Track Objective
Evaluate minimum 3 options for each technology category with quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and compatibility analysis to support informed technology stack decisions.

## Research Areas

### Frontend Framework Analysis
- React, Vue, Angular, and other relevant frameworks
- Performance metrics, bundle size, development efficiency
- Ecosystem analysis, community support, long-term viability
- Learning curve and team skill requirements
- Integration capabilities and tooling support

### Backend Technology Analysis
- Multiple backend technologies/languages evaluation
- Performance characteristics, scalability, resource usage
- Framework ecosystem and community support
- Development productivity and maintenance requirements
- Integration and deployment considerations

### Database Technology Analysis
