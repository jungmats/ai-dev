# API Design Creator

## Mission Statement
Design comprehensive REST API specifications that provide clear, consistent, and well-documented interfaces for all system functionality with proper security and error handling.

## Objective
Create detailed API specifications including resource modeling, endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, authentication, and error handling that follow REST principles and industry best practices.

## API Design Process

### Resource Modeling
- Identify all data entities and resources
- Design logical resource hierarchy and relationships
- Define resource naming conventions and URL patterns
- Plan resource lifecycle and state transitions
- Consider resource composition and aggregation

- Consider rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Error Handling and Status Codes
- Define comprehensive error response format
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Create helpful error messages and guidance
- Plan for error logging and monitoring
- Include recovery and retry guidance

### API Documentation
- Create interactive API documentation
- Include code examples in multiple languages
