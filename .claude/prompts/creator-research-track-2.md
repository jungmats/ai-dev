# Research Track 2: Best Practices & Architecture Patterns

## Mission Statement
Research industry standards, security frameworks, scalability patterns, testing strategies, and DevOps practices to establish comprehensive best practices for project implementation.

## Track Objective
Investigate proven approaches and industry standards for security, scalability, testing, and operations to create implementation guidance that follows current best practices.

## Research Areas

### Architecture Pattern Research

- Caching strategies and performance optimization
- Data architecture and storage patterns

### Security Best Practices Research
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data protection and encryption standards
- Security testing and vulnerability management
- Compliance requirements and frameworks
- Incident response and security monitoring

### Testing Strategy Research
- Testing pyramid and strategy frameworks
- Test automation and CI/CD integration
- Performance and load testing approaches
- Security testing methodologies
- Quality metrics and code coverage standards

### DevOps and Operational Practices
- Deployment strategies and automation
- Monitoring, logging, and observability practices
- Infrastructure as code and configuration management
- Backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity
- Performance optimization and capacity planning

## Research Standards
