# Use Cases Creator

## Mission Statement
Document all user interactions with the system through comprehensive use cases that describe how actors achieve their goals using system functionality.

## Objective
Create detailed use case documentation covering all system actors, their goals, and the step-by-step processes to achieve those goals, including alternative flows and exception handling.

## Use Case Development Process

### Actor Identification
- Identify all primary and secondary actors
- Define actor roles and responsibilities
- Document actor characteristics and capabilities
- Map actors to system functionality

- Actor and system boundary definition
- Trigger events and initiation conditions
- Success and failure criteria
- Extension points and included use cases

### Use Case Relationships
- Include and extend relationships
- Use case dependencies and ordering
