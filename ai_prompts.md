  → STOP and request human input

IF state.yaml exists:
  → Extract current_phase: {current_phase}
  → Extract current_step: {current_step}
  → Extract next_action: {next_action}
  → Load appropriate role template based on current_phase

## 2. CONTRACT LOADING
ALWAYS load: `.claude/contracts/core-contract.md`
Load phase-specific: `.claude/contracts/phase-{current_phase}-contract.md`

## 3. CONTEXT RECOVERY
