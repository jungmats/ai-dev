# AI-Driven Development Process

A comprehensive, phase-based development methodology that uses AI (Claude) as the primary developer with human validation at critical decision points. This process is fully status-aware, resumable, and designed to deliver high-quality software from concept to production.

## 🎯 Overview

This AI development process transforms rough project ideas into production-ready applications through six structured phases:

1. **Application Idea** - Structure concepts into actionable project definitions
2. **Research** - Comprehensive technical and market analysis
3. **Specification** - Detailed requirements and system design
4. **Proof of Concept** - Risk validation through minimal implementations
5. **Development** - Test-driven feature implementation
6. **Deployment** - Production-ready deployment and handover

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-First, Human-Validated
- AI handles the bulk of research, coding, testing, and documentation
- Humans validate at critical decision points and provide business guidance
- Systematic quality assurance through contracts and validation checklists

### 📊 Status-Aware & Resumable
- Complete project state tracking in `state.yaml`
- Resume work after any interruption (system restart, context switch)
- Granular progress tracking within each phase
- Clear audit trail of all decisions and changes

### 📋 Contract-Driven Quality
- Core contract defines universal development standards
- Phase-specific contracts ensure consistent deliverable quality
- Automated validation checklists for systematic quality assurance
- Self-review patterns reduce human oversight burden

### 🔄 Parallel & Sequential Execution
- Research tracks can run in parallel for faster completion
- Specification steps build sequentially for consistency
- Deployment tasks optimized for parallel execution
- Flexible execution based on project needs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of software development

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Clone the AI development process repository
   git clone https://github.com/jungmats/ai-dev.git
   cd ai-dev
   ```

2. **Initialize Your Project with Claude Code**
   ```bash
   # Create your project directory
   mkdir my-awesome-project
   cd my-awesome-project
   
   # Start Claude Code and run the setup
   claude-code
   ```
   
   In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   Read the complete_ai_dev_process.md file from the cloned repository to understand the complete AI development process structure. Familiarize yourself with .claude code and inspect all contract files to be respected, the prompt templates to be used, and the validation checklists to be run after each phase. Once you are ready, ask the user to provide a rough idea of the application they want to build.
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run the verification script to make sure all components are correctly set up
   chmod +x verify_setup.sh
   ./verify_setup.sh
   ```

4. **Start Your First Project**
   ```bash
   # Initialize the AI development session
   claude-code
   ```
   
   In Claude Code:
   ```
   Load the session-init prompt and begin the AI development process based on the application idea the user provided. Ask the user for any additional information needed at each phase and guide them through the process.
   ```
   
5. **Resume in case of interruption**
   ```bash
   # Initialize the AI development session
   claude-code
   ```
   
   In Claude Code:
   ```
   Check the state.yaml file to determine the current phase and step. Load the appropriate prompt for that phase and continue the process from where it left off.
   ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Application Idea
Transform your rough concept into a structured project definition:
- Clear problem statement and solution approach
- Target users and success criteria
- Scope boundaries and constraints
- Initial risk assessment
- Research questions for next phase

### Phase 2: Research (Parallel Execution)
Comprehensive analysis across three tracks:
- **Track 1**: Technology stack analysis (frameworks, databases, hosting)
- **Track 2**: Best practices and architecture patterns
- **Track 3**: Competitive analysis and market positioning
- **Consolidation**: Synthesized recommendations and implementation roadmap

### Phase 3: Specification (Sequential Steps)
Convert research into implementable specifications:
1. Functional requirements with SHALL/SHOULD/MAY format
2. Non-functional requirements with measurable criteria
3. Use cases covering all major interactions
4. User stories with testable acceptance criteria
5. API design following REST/GraphQL principles
6. Database schema with migration strategy
7. Complete architecture overview

### Phase 4: Proof of Concept
Validate technical assumptions through focused testing:
- Risk identification across performance, integration, and technology areas
- Minimal implementations for each high-priority risk
- Performance measurement and validation
- Architecture updates based on findings

### Phase 5: Development
Test-driven feature implementation:
- Feature prioritization by business value
- Low-level design and units of work breakdown
- TDD implementation (tests first, then code)
- Continuous integration and quality gates
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Phase 6: Deployment
Production-ready deployment and handover:
- Infrastructure as code setup
- Staging validation and testing
- Blue-green production deployment
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Complete documentation and handover materials

## 🎛️ AI Agent System

The process uses specialized AI agents for different responsibilities:

### Creator Agents
- **Session Init**: Determines current state and loads appropriate role
- **Idea Creator**: Structures project concepts
- **Research Agents**: 3 parallel tracks + consolidation
- **Specification Agents**: 7 sequential steps for complete specs
- **PoC Agent**: Risk validation through minimal implementations
- **Development Agent**: Test-driven feature implementation
- **Deployment Agents**: 3 parallel deployment tasks

### Validation Agent
- Systematic quality assurance using phase-specific checklists
- Contract compliance verification
- Structured validation reports with pass/fail/warning status
- Clear remediation guidance for issues

## 📊 Status Management

### Current State Tracking
The `state.yaml` file maintains complete project status:
- Current phase and specific step within phase
- Next action to take
- Progress percentage and completion status
- Deliverable tracking (completed vs pending)
- Error state and recovery options

### Resumability
- Work can be interrupted and resumed at any time
- No loss of context or progress
- Clear audit trail of all decisions
- Rollback capability to previous states

### Example Status Check
```yaml
status:
  current_phase: "research"
  current_step: "track-2-best-practices"
  next_action: "analyze_scalability_patterns"
  progress_percentage: 35

phases:
  research:
    completed_steps: ["track-1-frameworks"]
    remaining_steps: ["track-2-best-practices", "track-3-competition", "consolidate-findings"]
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adapting Contracts
Modify contracts in `.claude/contracts/` for your specific needs:
- **Core Contract**: Universal development standards
- **Phase Contracts**: Phase-specific requirements and formats
- Version contracts for different project types (web, mobile, API)

### Custom Validation
Extend validation checklists in `.claude/validations/`:
- Add organization-specific quality gates
- Include compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Customize for different technology stacks

### Process Variants
Create specialized versions for different contexts:
- Rapid prototyping (skip certain validation steps)
- Enterprise projects (additional security and compliance)
- Open source projects (community-focused documentation)
